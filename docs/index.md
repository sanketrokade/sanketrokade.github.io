# Supercomputing & Accelerated Computing

Welcome.

This site is a growing knowledge base on:

- High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Supercomputing systems
- Accelerated computing and programming

The goal is simple:
to explain **why things exist**, not just **how to use them**.

This site complements my LinkedIn writing
and serves as a permanent home for long-form explanations.
