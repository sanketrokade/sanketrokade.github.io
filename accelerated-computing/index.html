<h1>Accelerated Computing — From First Principles</h1>

<p>
This series explains accelerated computing from the ground up — not by starting with GPUs or CUDA,
but by first understanding <em>why</em> traditional CPUs stopped scaling and <em>why</em> acceleration became necessary.
</p>

<p>
The goal is clarity, not hype. No assumed expertise. Just solid foundations.
