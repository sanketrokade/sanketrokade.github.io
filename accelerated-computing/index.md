# Accelerated Computing

This is a first-principles deep-dive series on
**accelerated computing and programming**.

Topics include:
- Why CPUs are not enough
- Throughput vs latency
- Data movement and memory walls
- GPUs and other accelerators

This series assumes curiosity, not prior GPU experience.
