<h1>What Is an Operating System?</h1>
<p><em>A conversation between you and the machine.</em></p>

<h2>Let’s Start With an Uncomfortable Question</h2>

<p>You press the power button.</p>

<p>The screen lights up.<br>
The cursor blinks.<br>
Programs run.</p>

<p>But here’s the uncomfortable part:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hardware has no inherent concept of a program.</li>
<li>No concept of a file.</li>
<li>No concept of a process.</li>
<li>No built-in understanding of “run this next.”</li>
</ul>

<p>At the lowest level, hardware understands only electrical signals interpreted as machine instructions.</p>

<h2>If There Were No Operating System</h2>

<p>Imagine a computer with no operating system.</p>

<p>The CPU can do only one fundamental thing:</p>

<blockquote>
Fetch an instruction from a memory address, decode it, and execute it.
</blockquote>

<p>That is the entire model.</p>

<ul>
<li>No windows</li>
<li>No files</li>
<li>No multitasking</li>
<li>No users</li>
</ul>

<p>Just transistors switching states according to physical laws.</p>

<h2>So Who Teaches the Machine How to Behave?</h2>

<p>That role is played by the Operating System.</p>

<p>Not merely as an application,<br>
not as something you “open,”<br>
but as the foundational software layer that controls the machine.</p>

<p>The core of an operating system — the <strong>kernel</strong> — is the first software component that takes control of the CPU after boot.</p>

<p>It remains resident in memory for the entire lifetime of the system and executes in a privileged mode unavailable to ordinary programs.</p>

<h2>The OS Is Not a Single Thing — It Is a Set of Responsibilities</h2>

<p>People often ask:</p>

<blockquote>
“What is an operating system made of?”
</blockquote>

<p>A more useful question is:</p>

<blockquote>
“What decisions must be made for a computer to be usable and safe?”
</blockquote>

<p>These decisions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which process gets the CPU next (scheduling)</li>
<li>Where each process’s memory begins and ends (memory management)</li>
<li>How shared devices are accessed safely (I/O coordination)</li>
<li>What happens when a program crashes or misbehaves (protection and isolation)</li>
</ul>

<p>The operating system exists to make these decisions continuously, efficiently, and securely.</p>

<h2>A Useful Mental Model: The OS as an Abstraction Layer</h2>

<p>Humans think in terms of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Programs</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>User actions</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware understands only:</p>

<ul>
<li>Registers</li>
<li>Memory addresses</li>
<li>Interrupts</li>
<li>Clock signals</li>
</ul>

<p>The operating system provides <strong>abstractions</strong> that translate human intent into controlled hardware activity.</p>

<p>Files become structured blocks on storage.<br>
Processes become scheduled execution contexts.<br>
Clicks become interrupts and system calls.</p>

<h2>How the OS Actually Starts</h2>

<p>When a system boots:</p>

<ol>
<li>Firmware (such as BIOS or UEFI) begins execution</li>
<li>A bootloader loads the operating system kernel into memory</li>
<li>The kernel initializes hardware, memory, and scheduling</li>
<li>User-space programs are launched under kernel supervision</li>
</ol>

<p>From this point forward:</p>

<p>Ordinary programs do not access hardware directly.<br>
They request services via system calls.<br>
The kernel enforces boundaries and permissions.</p>

<h2>Historical Note</h2>

<p>Early computers had no operating systems.</p>

<p>Programs were loaded manually using switches or punched cards. Only one program could run at a time, and a crash often required restarting the entire machine.</p>

<p>The operating system emerged as complexity demanded coordination, safety, and efficiency.</p>

<h2>What You Should Understand Now</h2>

<ul>
<li>An operating system is not just “Windows” or “Linux”</li>
<li>Hardware alone cannot manage modern computational complexity</li>
<li>The OS provides abstractions, protection, and resource management</li>
<li>It acts as the guardian between software and hardware</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Comes Next</h2>

<p>If the operating system exists to make decisions…</p>

<p><strong>Why was it needed in the first place?</strong></p>
