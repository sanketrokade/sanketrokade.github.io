  <h1>Supercomputing For Everyone</h1>

  <p>
    This section indexes my LinkedIn newsletter,
    <strong>“Supercomputing For Everyone”</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The articles are organized quarter-wise and focus on building
    conceptual understanding of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems,
    from fundamentals to emerging exascale architectures.
